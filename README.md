This texture pack for the 2023 PC Master Collection version of Metal Gear Solid 2 fully restores all the game's textures back to their pre-2011 HD Collection versions, reverting Bluepoint's "remastering", which in many cases was simply Bluepoint lazily running the game's textures through Sony PCL's [Real Scaling for HD](https://gigazine.net/gsc_news/en/20110808_sonypcl_real_scaling_for_hd/) anime upscaler and calling it a day.

Optional AI Upscaled versions are also available, in some cases the results actually come out better than Bluepoint's upscaling, funnily enough.
