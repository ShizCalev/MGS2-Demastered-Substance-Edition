This texture pack for the 2023 PC Master Collection version of Metal Gear Solid 2 fully restores all the game's textures back to their pre-2011 HD Collection / 2003 Substance versions, reverting Bluepoint's "remastering", which in many cases was simply Bluepoint lazily running the game's textures through Sony PCL's [Real Scaling for HD](https://gigazine.net/gsc_news/en/20110808_sonypcl_real_scaling_for_hd/) anime upscaler and calling it a day. ([Source on Bluepoint's upscaler](https://i.imgur.com/5H4rZyc.png))

A Sons of Liberty version will be released at a later date! (Some areas, such as the Shell 1 Core B2 Computer Room, were fairly heavily retextured between 2001 Sons of Liberty -> 2002/2003 Substance.)

Optional AI Upscaled versions are also available, in some cases the results actually come out better than Bluepoint's upscaling, funnily enough.
